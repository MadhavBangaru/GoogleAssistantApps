Recently, Google launched a developer program for Google Assistant. This program was launched with the incentive to engage users to Google Assistant. Google invited a ton of developers from all around the world to join their developer community to build some cool apps for Google Assistant.

There are two very cool things about this community program. First, you don’t need to be a developer to built apps. So, stay tuned because I’m going to tell you how you can build some cool apps and get them published even if you don’t know how to write code.

And second, if your app gets published, then Google will send you an exclusive Google Assistant t-shirt — and your account associated with that app will be credited with up to $200 of cloud services every month for the next year. And also you will get some more awards and perks when your app crosses certain milestones.

So, let’s get started. First of all, go to the Google Assistant developer community program. Then you will land on this page.
